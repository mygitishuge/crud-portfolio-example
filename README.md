# crud-portfolio-example
Basic CRUD application for a small business to keep track of its sales and purchases, built as an example for my portfolio to illustrate my ability to work effectively` with a database technology

The idea was inspired by my employment in a retail store where the managers were terribly coordinated and their system constantly failed them.

I realised that their system was outdated as they were using a legacy system built in C++ with minimal networking features and impossible to access from the phones ofthe managers of employees. Whilst this version is still in its infancy it demonstrates the underlying system necessary for such an application to work.
